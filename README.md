Upgrades:
-GameStates and Players are now stored in Maps, eliminating need for functions that check each array entries id.
-Game data is now stored in classes with helper methods
-conditional rendering is controlled using primarily the gamephase enum rather than checking for multiple seemingly unrelated conditionals in gamestate

-

Things to do:
-incorporate error handler on client (error context?)
